/**
 * There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

 You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

 Each child must have at least one candy.
 Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 What is the minimum candies you must give?

    //very cool trick .. follow the underwritten steps -
    // 1) create a position array with position[i] = i;
    // 2) sort the position array according to the ratings
    //3) now iterate through position array from left to right which means position with smallest rating to highest rating
    //4) check if rating of ith element is greater than i-1 position . If yes take the maximum of 1 and
    // candies assigned to i-1th positon and increment it by 1 and assign it to ith member.

    //5) Do similar stuff for checking rating of i with i+1th element . assign to i the max between 1 and candies[i+1] + 1
    //6) keep a runnning count and return count at last.
