/**
 * Given a set of n integers, divide the set in two subsets of n/2 sizes
 * each such that the difference of the sum of two subsets is as minimum as possible.
 * If n is even, then sizes of two subsets must be strictly n/2 and if n is odd,
 * then size of one subset must be (n-1)/2 and size of other subset must be (n+1)/2.

 For example, let given set be {1,5,6,2},
 the size of set is 4.
 Output for this set should be {1,6} and {5,2}.
 Both output subsets are of size 5 and sum of elements in both subsets is same (148 and 148)
